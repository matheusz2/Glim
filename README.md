# 🌌 GLIM – Immersive and Emotional Social Network

## 🎯 Overview

**GLIM** is an innovative social network that redefines digital interaction by transforming it into a symbolic, sensory, and emotional experience.  
Each user is represented by a **Living Cell** – a dynamic 3D entity that evolves based on emotions, interactions, and internal states.

---

## 🎨 Key Features

### 🧬 Living Cell
- Visual and interactive 3D representation of the user
- Evolves with emotional input and social activity
- Fully customizable and responsive to stimuli
- Features a "Glow System" to express emotional reactions

### 👁️ VISTA Mode
- Immersive experience inside another user's Living Cell
- View symbolic, AI-curated feeds
- Interact with orbital fragments (memories, posts, signals)
- Time-limited sessions secured by token-based access

### 🌀 Orbital Fragments
- AI-generated content: text, images, sounds, symbols
- Contextual and emotionally relevant
- Absorbed or shared across cells
- Created through integrations with OpenAI and Stability AI

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- `React` + `TypeScript`
- `Three.js` via `React Three Fiber` for 3D rendering
- `TailwindCSS` for styling
- `Zustand` for state management
- `Framer Motion` for smooth animations

### Backend
- `Node.js` with `Express`
- `Supabase` (Authentication + PostgreSQL)
- `Firebase` (Push Notifications)
- `Socket.IO` for real-time interactions
- AI integrations via `OpenAI`, `Stability AI`, and future model endpoints

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- JWT-based authentication and session control
- Token expiration for secure immersive experiences (VISTA)
- Backend-only handling of sensitive data
- Protection against scraping, tampering, and API abuse
- Input/output sanitization for all user-generated content

---

## 🎮 Core Interactions

### 1. Exploration
- Navigate the GLIMverse by jumping between Living Cells
- Browse and react to orbital fragments
- Leave symbolic feedback using glows

### 2. VISTA
- Enter symbolic space of another user
- Temporarily experience their curated emotional feed
- Leave behind echoes (memories, fragments, symbolic gestures)

### 3. Creation
- Generate new orbital fragments (AI-assisted)
- Personalize Living Cell appearance and behavior
- Share meaningful content rooted in emotional expression

---

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Systems
- ✅ Living Cell base component
- ✅ Authentication (Supabase + JWT)
- ✅ Fragment structure and generation logic

### Phase 2: Immersion Features
- ⏳ VISTA mode integration
- ⏳ Glow reaction system
- ⏳ AI generation endpoints (OpenAI, Stability AI)

### Phase 3: Social Layer
- ⏳ Adaptive emotional feed
- ⏳ Real-time notifications and events
- ⏳ Community and cell-to-cell symbolic interactions

---

## 📝 Developer Notes

- Modularize all visual and data components
- Prioritize GPU performance and frame rate for 3D environments
- Document all AI integrations and abstract external calls
- Maintain separation of UI/Logic/AI layers for scalability
- Test immersive sessions extensively for UX flow and memory handling

---

## 🔮 Future Vision

- Expand fragment formats: dreams, scents (symbolic), vibrations
- Introduce AI personas and guides for each user cell
- Curated themed constellations for communities
- Immersive digital events, rituals, and emotion-based challenges
- Support for VR/AR integrations and smart wearables

## 💡 Inspiration

GLIM was born from the desire to humanize digital communication — bringing emotion, symbolism, and self-expression to the core of social technology.  
It’s more than a platform. It’s a living space for inner connection and shared presence.
